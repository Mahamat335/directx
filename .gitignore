# Ignore files and directories generated by CMake and build processes
# ===================================================================
# Completely ignore the main directory where CMake places all build
# outputs and cache files. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE.
/build/

# Ignore user-specific settings and tool caches
# ===============================================
# VSCode workspace settings.
/.vscode/

# Clangd's project-specific index cache.
/.cache/

# Files that Visual Studio might generate (if you open the project with it)
/.vs/
*.VC.db
*.sln
*.vcxproj
*.vcxproj.filters
*.vcxproj.user

# Ignore compiled files and artifacts
# ===================================
# (Most of these will be inside /build/ anyway, but this is a good safeguard)
*.exe
*.obj
*.lib
*.dll
*.pdb
*.ilk
*.aps
*.tlog
*.idb
